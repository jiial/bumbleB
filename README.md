# bumbleB
BDD framework for my master's thesis project.


bumbleB is a behavior driven testing framework for Java where tests are written in Java code, in an easy-to-read syntax. bumbleB is built on top of JUnit and leverages Java's
annotation processing in order to provide plain text descriptions of the tests. The descriptions are generated based on 
step definitions declared in bumbleB's [@Step](annotationsB/src/main/java/com/jiial/bumbleB/annotations/Step.java)-annotations. bumbleB supports the given-when-then syntax, but also allows
the creation of custom keywords to extend the syntax. bumbleB tests are created using the ExampleBuilder in the [Framework](frameworkB/src/main/java/com/jiial/bumbleB/framework/Framework.java) class.
The builder can be provided a name, a narrative, and a set of steps to execute. The steps are passed on as method 
references with the help of bumbleB's keyword-methods (given/when/then/and).


An example written in bumbleB might look like this:
```
public class CalculatorTests {

    private CalculatorSteps calculatorSteps = new CalculatorSteps();

    @Example
    public void calculatorSumTest() {
        builder
                .name("The calculator can calculate the sum of two numbers correctly")
                .steps(
                        given(calculatorSteps::inputNumbers, 1, 2),
                        when(calculatorSteps::chooseFunction, "sum"),
                        then(calculatorSteps::checkResult, 3)
                )
                .build()
                .run();
    }
}
```
The steps used in the tests might look like this:
```
public class CalculatorSteps {

  private Calculator calculator = new Calculator();
  private int actualResult;

  @Step("a user input the numbers {num1} and {num2}")
  public void inputNumbers(int num1, int num2) {
    calculator.input(num1, num2);
  }

  @Step("the user chooses the {functionName} function")
  public void chooseFunction(String functionName) {
    if (functionName.equals("sum")) {
      actualResult = calculator.sum();
    } else {
      // TODO: Implement other functions
    }
  }

  @Step("the result is: {expectedResult}")
  public void checkResult(int expectedResult) {
    Assert.assertEquals(expectedResult, actualResult);
  }
}
```
And the resulting text file generated by the [Example processor](processorsB/src/main/java/com/jiial/bumbleB/processors/ExampleProcessor.java) would look like this:
```
Example: The calculator can calculate the sum of two numbers correctly

Given a user input the numbers {num1} and {num2}
When the user chooses the {functionName} function
Then the result is: {expectedResult}
```


The full documentation can be seen [here](Documentation.md).

Example usages are available in the [examplesB-project](examplesB).

### Known issues
* ExampleProcessor can't handle step prefixes/keywords with more than one word
* ExampleProcessor can't handle cases where custom prefix/keyword methods are called without a static import, e.g. 
  ExtendedFramework.after() instead of just after()

### Features to implement
* Add support for adding steps to existing example definitions in order to support shared before- or after-steps
  * Initial attempt caused an error at runtime for unknown reasons (and the changes were reverted)
  * In addition, the text files generated by the annotation processor were missing the shared steps that were declared 
    outside the test method annotated with [@Example](annotationsB/src/main/java/com/jiial/bumbleB/annotations/Example.java)
